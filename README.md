## CA-forecasting

EJ Arce and Jonathan Matz

We have obtained multiple datasets of results from California legilative elections from 1968 through 2016. After cleaning and merging these into one coherent dataset, we will analyze variables at the candidate level, and see which variables act as effective predictors in deciding election outcomes. From there, we will build models to forecast the results of the upcoming 2018 legislative election.
